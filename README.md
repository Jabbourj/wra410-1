For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

## Changes made

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
   - Changed backgroound color of home to #F5F1DE, which is a beige. And changed the div container to #87CEEB, also changed the nav bar text color to #003333.
2. Use a new font.
I used a google font, CODA Caption, for the resources page text.

3. I uploaded a Sublime Image and a atom image on the resources pages.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
 I created a table for GPA comparison with number value and point value.
5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
I put each group in to their own box and they are spaced out. I also added green to the links
6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage.
Put a nav bar underneath the header. 
7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
I changed the % of each column to make it more appealing and neat.
